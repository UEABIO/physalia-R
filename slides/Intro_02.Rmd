# Introduction to R 

* Naming objects and entering data
* How to troubleshoot and where to find help  

---

## First some terms

```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width="85%", fig.alt = "An R object saved by using the assignment operator <- a dataframe called sloth_df is piped into the function select with arguments id, age and speed"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/terms.png")

# **1. Naming things and entering data**


---

### Resources for the basics of good data science and good coding practice

* [Understanding files and directories](https://www.theverge.com/22684730/students-file-folder-directory-structure-education-gen-z)

* [How to organise your spreadsheets](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/00031305.2017.1375989)

* [R coding basics](https://rstudio.cloud/learn/primers/1.2)

* [The tidyverse style guide](https://style.tidyverse.org/)

## Naming things

### When naming variables, observations, dataframes or files make them:

.pull-left[
* Meaningful

* Consistent

* Concise

* Readable
]

---

## Naming things

### When naming variables, observations, dataframes or files make them:

.pull-left[
* **Meaningful**



* Consistent



* Concise



* Readable
]

.pull-right[
* Names of variables, data frames, and files should not be so generic/vague that a user must need a glossary to know what they contain

* Names should be specific to the data/experiment/project, and the more intuitive their interpretation the better

* **Bad examples:** File-1.xlsx, file-2.csv, indicator1, indicator2, ExperimentA.R, ExperimentB.R

* **Better examples:** taco_nutrients.csv, ca-demographics, mice_1a_mass, sb_channel_spatial.shp

## Naming things

### When naming variables, observations, dataframes or files make them:

.pull-left[
* Meaningful



* **Consistent**



* Concise



* Readable
]

.pull-right[
* Keep names **identical** for identical entries (e.g. “burrito-32” and “Burrito 32” are *different things* to R)

* Be consistent **across data frames** - your life will be easier if you have year called ‘year’ in both sets.

* Use logical suffixes (if necessary), consistently formatted. Like: temp_water_surface, temp_water_sub, temp_water_bottom

## Naming things

### When naming variables, observations, dataframes or files make them:

.pull-left[
* Meaningful



* Consistent



* **Concise**



* Readable
]

.pull-right[
* Balance meaningfulness w/conciseness

* Better to be descriptive than not know what a variable is

* Longer names = tedious coding, but less effort to look through metadata for column/identifier names



]

## Naming things

### When naming variables, observations, dataframes or files make them:

.pull-left[
* Meaningful



* Consistent



* Concise



* **Readable**
]

.pull-right[
* Avoid punctuation (%, !, ~, ( ), #) in names - more challenging to type & can break code.

* Avoid spaces (makes coding much more difficult)

* Avoid starting object names with numbers (but could be useful for file names in sequence)

]
---

## Naming things

### When naming variables, observations, dataframes or files make them:

.pull-left[
* Meaningful



* Consistent



* Concise



* **Readable**
]

.pull-right[

* Avoid naming objects that are also commonly used functions (like filter or select)

* Pick (and be consistent with) a choice of case, like:
    * **lowercase_snake_case** (my favorite)
    * camelCase
    * UpperCamelCase
    * kebab-case
    * SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE

]

---

## Entering data

* The outcomes for a variable (whether values or descriptions) should exist alone in a column

* Be very consistent when entering descriptions (e.g. “Purple” v. “purple” v. “purple_”)

* Avoid formatting and symbols (if it’s hard to type, then it’s hard to type...and might cause issues beyond that)

* Put any additional information (units, notes, etc.) in columns separate from the value/description

* If there are missings, enter the **same exact thing** for each missing value (common: NA, -- or -)


---

## Data entry

.pull-left[
### Bad:
```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width="90%", fig.alt = "Inconsistent data entry, units in the column of berry mass, observations mixed in with units"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/bad_df.png")
```

]

--

.pull-right[
### Better:
```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width="90%", fig.alt = "Units included in title, consistent use of snake case, each column is a unique variable, each row is an observation. Notes in separate column"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/good_df.png")
```


]


---

## Keep a clear record of your naming system

### And plan on forgetting it!

### Keep a project description with: 

  * The name of your variable in the data and a longer description of what it means
    
  * What are the units
    
  * How you have indicated a missing record. [Why is it missing?](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Missing_data)

# **2. Help yourself in R:**

## Finding resources and tips for troubleshooting


---

## What package or function should I use?

### **Google it:**

  * Search with the keywords and package/function name if known, and include .R in the search keywords (e.g. “dplyr::mutate add column in .R” instead of “mutate variable”).
    
  * “R” is generic - so consider using “R software” or “.R”
    
  * Start learning and using language common in R communities & publications (e.g. [R4DS](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/)), like data frame instead of spreadsheet
    
  * For now, anything reading, wrangling, ggplot2 related: considering navigating to documentation from [tidyverse.org](https://www.tidyverse.org/), [rdocumentation](https://www.rdocumentation.org/), or [RStudio community](https://community.rstudio.com/). 

---

## How do I know there’s an error, and where to look for it? 

* When you save a script, lines of code with some errors (e.g. unmatched parentheses) will have a red circle with an x in it next to the line number

```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width="50%", fig.alt = "Syntax error"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/console_error.png")
```

* You might also see a red squiggly line under part of your code, indicating a syntax issue. You can hover over the squiggly to see a pop-up hint about what’s going on. 

---

## Error messages will show up* in the Console when you try to run the broken code: 


```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width="50%", fig.alt = "Console error"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/error_output.png")
```

## Fact
### Sometimes walking away is the most productive

```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width="50%", fig.alt = "Things will look better in the morning"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/Error.jpg")
```

---

## There are multiple types of messages that R will print. Read the message to figure out what it’s trying to tell you. 

* **Error:** There’s a fatal error in your code that prevented it from being run through successfully. You need to fix it for the code to run. 

* **Warning:** Non-fatal errors (don’t stop the code from running, but this is a potential problem that you should know about).

* **Message:** Here’s some helpful information about the code you just ran (you can hide these if you want to)

---
class: center

### Read the error message
--

## Read the error message
--

# Read the error message

Sometimes it will be infuriatingly vague, but often it will tell you exactly how to fix it (e.g. “do you need ==?”). 

```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width="50%", fig.alt = "Always read the error message"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/misspelling.png")
```

---

## Troubleshooting

* Symptom: `Error in _________: could not find function “_________”`


* Diagnosis: 
    * The `library()` containing the function hasn't been called
    * The function has been misspelled

---

## Troubleshooting

* Symptom: `Error in ____ : object ‘_____’ not found’`

* Diagnosis: 
    * The object hasn’t been created or stored
    * You’ve mistyped the object name

---

## Troubleshooting
  
### If R…tells you it’s ignoring an argument within a function

* Symptom: `Warning: Ignoring unknown parameters: ____`

* Diagnosis: 
    * You’ve included an argument that doesn’t exist for that function
    * You’ve mistyped an argument that does exist for that function
---

## Troubleshooting

* Look over code very carefully - character-by-character and space-by-space. Run line-by-line to see where it breaks. 

--

* Google the copied & pasted error message. **Someone else has encountered and solved it before**.

--

* Take a break and come back to it later. ☕
