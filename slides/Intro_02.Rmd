]

.pull-right[


Save files in specific locations, with intentional and useful names: 

- Short and informative names

- Easy to sort and cooperate with partial searches

- Be careful with special characters and spaces

- Use relative filepaths

## Data wrangling

* Naming things

* Coding basics & tidyverse wrangling/viz

* Good coding habits

* Code annotation & organization

* Data visualization

* Troubleshooting 

* Relative file paths

* Literate programming

# **1. Naming things and entering data**


---

## When naming variables, observations, dataframes or files make them:

.pull-left[
* Meaningful

* Consistent

* Concise

* Readable
]

---

## When naming variables, observations, dataframes or files make them:

.left-code[
* **Meaningful**



* Consistent



* Concise



* Readable
]

.right-plot[
* Names of variables, data frames, and files should not be so generic/vague that a user must need a glossary to know what they contain

* Names should be specific to the data/experiment/project, and the more intuitive their interpretation the better

* **Bad examples:** File-1.xlsx, file-2.csv, indicator1, indicator2, ExperimentA.R, ExperimentB.R

* **Better examples:** 01_import_mice_assay_data.R, 20231109_dros_behav.csv, 20231004_ms_culex_biting.docx

]

---

## When naming variables, observations, dataframes or files make them:

.left-code[
* Meaningful



* **Consistent**



* Concise



* Readable
]

.right-plot[
* Keep names **identical** for identical entries (e.g. ‚Äúburrito-32‚Äù and ‚ÄúBurrito 32‚Äù are *different things* to R)

* Be consistent **across data frames** - your life will be easier if you have year called ‚Äòyear‚Äô in both sets.

* Use logical suffixes (if necessary), consistently formatted. Like: temp_water_surface.csv, temp_water_sub.csv, temp_water_bottom.csv


]

---

## When naming variables, observations, dataframes or files make them:

.left-code[
* Meaningful



* Consistent



* **Concise**



* Readable
]

.right-plot[
* Balance meaningfulness w/conciseness

* Better to be descriptive than not know what a variable is

* Longer names = tedious coding, but less effort to look through metadata for column/identifier names


]

---

## When naming variables, observations, dataframes or files make them:

.left-code[
* Meaningful



* Consistent



* Concise



* **Readable**
]

.right-plot[
* Avoid punctuation (%, !, ~, ( ), #) in names - more challenging to type & can break code.

* Avoid spaces (makes coding much more difficult)

* Avoid starting object names with numbers (but could be useful for file names in sequence)
]

## When naming variables, observations, dataframes or files make them:

.left-code[
* Meaningful



* Consistent



* Concise



* **Readable**
]

.right-plot[

* Avoid naming objects that are also commonly used functions (like filter or select)

* Pick (and be consistent with) a choice of case, like:
    * **lowercase_snake_case** (my favorite)
    * camelCase
    * UpperCamelCase
    * kebab-case
    * SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE

## Project organisation


### Project

Have one directory than contains all of the relevant files for a project or analysis

- [Project Oriented Workflow](https://www.tidyverse.org/blog/2017/12/workflow-vs-script/)

### Contains

üìÅ Data

üìÅ Scripts

üìÅ Outputs

---

## R projects

.pull-left[

Basically, they create the environment where

- all code and outputs are stored in one set location (no more `setwd()`!)

- relative file paths are created - this guarantees better reproducibility

- clean R environment is created every time you open it (no more `rm(list = ls()`)!)

]

.pull-right[

```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/jb_tweet.png")
```

]

---

## Save the source

.pull-left[

- Keep scripts as the analysis pathway

- Export figures and results to files

- Keep your session as a "Blank Slate" - restart R

- **Do not** save or load workspace between sessions

]

.pull-right[

```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width="85%"}

## Resources for good coding practice


* [How to organise your spreadsheets](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/00031305.2017.1375989)

* [R coding basics](https://rstudio.cloud/learn/primers/1.2)

* [tidyverse style guide](https://style.tidyverse.org/)

---

## Why?

* Consistency and project organisation will help you: work with collaborators, get feedback on code, publish your analyses.

* Consistency also helps with troubleshooting

## Collaborators
### Who is a collaborator?

* Your current and future coworkers

* Your future self

---

## Important things: 



* Organisation

--

* Clear annotation

--

* Consistent formatting

üëé BAD READABILITY

```
object_name <- df %>% filter(col_a == ‚Äúyes‚Äù, col_b == ‚Äúburritos‚Äù, col_c != ‚Äúeggplant‚Äù) %>% select(col_b:col_e) %>% mutate(new_col = col_f + col_g) %>% group_by(col_b, col_d) %>% summarize(new_col_2 = mean(new_col))

```

üëç GOOD READABILITY

```

 col_b == ‚Äúburritos‚Äù,

# Coding considerations

*Good coding style is like correct punctuation: you can get by without it*

## Writing your code well from day one

.pull-left[
- Generous and clear commments

- logical and efficient code

- code that is tested (and timed!)
]

.pull-right[

```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width="200%"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/code_sections.png")
```
]

---

## Break up your analysis

.pull-left[

```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width="85%"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/Project.png")
```
]

.pull-right[

-  Sometimes running a full project from one script even with clearest and informatively named code sections is simply difficult

- Write specific scripts for particular jobs

- Use .RDS files to save the outputs between sections (and time)
