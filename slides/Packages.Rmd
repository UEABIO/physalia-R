# Adding Functions

`usethis::use_r()` 
- creates a new code file for you write your function

- places file correctly in the `R` folder

- the new file is entirely blank

```
> usethis::use_r("my_mean")
● Modify 'R/my_mean.R'
```

---
# Adding Functions

Let's write our first function

```{r}
my_mean <- function(x) {
  mean(na.omit(x))
}
```
--
For EVERY non-base R function you need to either *import* the function, or use `::` to reference the function

```{r}
my_mean <- function(x) {
  mean(stats::na.omit(x))
}
```

We will now use {roxygen2} comments in our code to document our new function (aka write the help file)!

---
# Adding Functions: Documentation

* R function help files (\*.Rd) are saved in the *man* folder

* the *man* folder already exists courtesy of `usethis::create_package()`

* R processes the \*.Rd files to create plain text, PDF, and HTML versions of the help files

* the code in \*.Rd files looks somewhat like LaTeX: it's verbose and cumbersome to write

* we will automate the creation of these files with {roxygen2} comments

* by automating, we link the function code to the documentation 

* this helps keep the documentation up to date

```
> usethis::use_roxygen_md()
✔ Setting Roxygen field in DESCRIPTION to 'list(markdown = TRUE)'
✔ Setting RoxygenNote field in DESCRIPTION to '6.1.1'
● Run `devtools::document()`
```

---
# Adding Functions: Documentation

* roxygen comments appear above a function

* roxygen comment lines always begins with `#'`

* two common roxygen tags
  - `@param` used to document a function argument
  - `@export` tells roxygen to export the function when the package is built

```{r}
#' The first line is the title
#'
#' The second section is a longer description of the function.
#' This can go on for multiple lines.
#' 
#' @param x numeric vector
#' @export
my_mean <- function(x) {
  mean(stats::na.omit(x))
}
```

---
# Adding Functions: Documentation

* other notable roxygen tags
  - `@examples` add examples to function help file
  - `@author` list author(s) of the function
  - `@return` specify the returned object 



* additional resources
  - *Rd* vignette in {roxygen2} package
  - Blog post http://kbroman.org/pkg_primer/pages/docs.html

# Unit Tests

There are many types of checks that can be included
.pull-left[
* `expect_lte() `
* `expect_gte()`
* `expect_equal() `
* `expect_setequal() `
* `expect_equivalent() `
* `expect_identical() `
]
.pull-right[
* `expect_length()`
* `expect_null()`
* `expect_error() `
* `expect_warning()`
* `expect_true()`
]

Each test should 
1. have an informative name  
1. cover a single unit of functionality

The idea is that when a test fails, you’ll know what’s wrong and where in your code to look for the problem.

Hadley Wickham's book on writing R packages provides a thorough review on writing unit tests.

# Include Datasets

.pull-left[
- including datasets in an R package is easy with `use_data_raw()` and `use_data()`

- we'll go over an example where we simulate a dataset and save it in the package

```{r}
> usethis::use_data_raw()
#> ✔ Creating 'data-raw/'
#> ✔ Adding '^data-raw$' to '.Rbuildignore'
#> Next:
#> ● Add data creation scripts 
#>    in 'data-raw/'
#> ● Use `usethis::use_data()` to 
#>    add data to package
```
]
--
.pull-right[
- simulate dataset, and `use_data()` will save it with the package

- save this script is the `data-raw/` folder

```{r}
set.seed(8976) # remeber to set your seed!
my_data <-
  tibble::tibble(
    x = runif(100),
    y = runif(100)
  )

usethis::use_data(my_data, overwrite = TRUE)
#> ✔ Creating 'data/'
#> ✔ Saving 'my_data' to 'data/my_data.rda'
```

]

---
# Include Datasets

.pull-left[
- document the dataset

- use {roxygen2} comments for documentation

- add a file to the R folder to begin documenting

- I call mine `data.R`
```
> usethis::use_r("data")
● Modify 'R/data.R'
```
]
--
.pull-right[
`R/data.R`
```
#' My simulated data

#' \describe{
#'     \item{x}{Random Uniform Variable}
#'     \item{y}{Random Uniform Variable}
#' }

# Other Tips

- {roxygen2} tags `@import` and `@importFrom`

- `use_pipe()` to import and export {magrittr} pipe operator

- helper functions for tidy development

---
# Other Tips: Import

- there are a few functions from the tidyverse we use frequently

- referring to them with `::` quickly becomes cumbersome

- we can import functions and even entire packages to avoid the `::` notation

- {roxygen2} tags `@import` and `@importFrom`

---
# Other Tips: Import
.pull-left[
- remember that boring package-level documentation file we made with `use_package_doc()`? let's use this file to import commonly used functions

```
#' @import dplyr
#' @import purrr
#' @importFrom tidyr nest unnest 
     spread gather complete
#' @importFrom tibble tibble as_tibble
#' @importFrom rlang .data %||% set_names sym 
     expr enexpr quo enquo parse_expr
#' @importFrom glue glue
#' @keywords internal
"_PACKAGE"

# allowing for the use of the dot when piping
utils::globalVariables(".")
```
]
.pull-right[
- when adding entire package imports, be sure to run the package checks. you may experience warnings from conflicting function names 
  - this is common with tidyverse packages as many of them contain the same functions
  
- `@import` and `@importFrom` can be placed in any R code file
  - can import same function in multiple files. {roxygen2} will sort out duplicates when the package is documented

- use the package-level documentation file for imports that apply to all functions in your package
]
???
mention that generally it's best practice to use `::` notation.  but readability of your code is more important and if importing functions improves readability then do it.

also discuss the global variables issue and why the last line is included

---
# Other Tips: the pipe

.pull-left[
- the {magrittr} pipe operator is so useful, you may want to both import and export it to make it available to users of your package

```
> usethis::use_pipe()
✔ Adding 'magrittr' to Imports 
    field in DESCRIPTION
✔ Writing 'R/utils-pipe.R'
● Run `devtools::document()`
```
]
.pull-right[

```
#' Pipe operator
#'
#' See \code{magrittr::\link[magrittr]{\%>\%}} 
#' for details.
#'
#' @name %>%
#' @rdname pipe
#' @keywords internal
#' @export
#' @importFrom magrittr %>%
#' @usage lhs \%>\% rhs
NULL
```
]

---
# Other Tips: tidy helpers

the {usethis} package contains helper functions to develop tidy packages

these are my favorites

- `use_tidy_description()`
  - puts fields in standard order and alphabetizes dependencies in DESCRIPTION file

- `use_tidy_versions(overwrite = FALSE)`
  - pins all dependencies to require at least the currently installed version
  - helps ensure your package will work on all systems

- `use_tidy_style(strict = TRUE)`
  - uses the {styler} package to style all code according to the tidyverse style guide
  - keeps your code easy to read, looking good, and collaborative

# Non-Standard Evaluation

- how to make the code precise?
 - import the `.data` function from {rlang}
 - use `.data$<varname>` EVERY time you reference a column within a `mutate` statement
 - if you don't use `.data`, the package check will return a warning

.pull-left[
```{r, eval = TRUE}
y = 10
tibble(
  x = 1:4
) %>%
  mutate(             #<<
    xy = .data$x + y  #<<  
  )                   #<<
```
]
.pull-right[
```{r, eval = TRUE}
tibble(
  y = 4:1,
  x = 1:4
) %>%
  mutate(                   #<<
    xy = .data$x + .data$y  #<<  
  )                         #<<
```

# Non-Standard Evaluation

- other tidyverse functions take bare column names as inputs
  - e.g. `mtcars %>% select(mpg, hp)`
  - the reference to the `mpg` and `hp` columns is not standard, and the package check will return warnings if this code is found
- many tidyverse functions will allow you to simply replace the bare references with quoted strings

.pull-left[
```{r, eval = FALSE}
mtcars %>% select(mpg, hp)

mtcars %>% pull(mpg)

mtcars %>% group_by(cyl) %>% 
  nest(mpg, hp)
```
]
.pull-right[
```{r, eval = FALSE}
mtcars %>% select(c("mpg", "hp"))

mtcars %>% pull("mpg")

mtcars %>% group_by(cyl) %>% 
  nest(c("mpg", "hp"))
```
]


???
group_by is NOT one of these functions!

# Non-Standard Evaluation

- for functions that do not allow you to simply add a string, use `!!` and `rlang::sym()`
- when you have multiple variables, use `!!!` and `rlang::syms()` instead of `!!` and `rlang::sym()` 

.pull-left[
```{r, eval = FALSE}
mtcars %>% group_by(cyl)


mtcars %>% group_by(cyl, am)
```
]
.pull-right[
```{r, eval = FALSE}
mtcars %>% group_by(!!sym("cyl"))
mtcars %>% group_by(.data$cyl)

by_vars <- c("cyl", "am")
mtcars %>% group_by(!!!syms(by_vars))
mtcars %>% group_by(.data$cyl, .data$am)
```
]

# Non-Standard Evaluation

- entire expressions can be stored as string and evaluated 

- this is particularly powerful when combined with the {glue} package

.pull-left[
```{r, eval = FALSE}
mtcars %>% filter(cyl == 4)
```
]
.pull-right[
```{r, eval = FALSE}
mtcars %>% filter(!!parse_expr("cyl == 4"))
mtcars %>% filter(.data$cyl == 4)
```
]

- can also create functions with NSE inputs

- briefly, you replace `sym()` with `enquo()`, more on that in the additional reading

- additional resources

# Collaborate with GitHub

- create a development branch (e.g. *dev*) and do 100% of your initial package building directly on this branch

- once package is standing on its own legs (not necessarily done), make all updates via forks or feature branches

- protect your *master* and *dev* branches
  - from the GitHub repo, select *Settings*, select *Branches*, and add rules for each branch
  
  - for the *dev* and  *master* branches, I recommend 
  
      - "Require pull request reviews before merging" 
      
      - "Require status checks to pass before merging" 
      
      - "Include administrators"
