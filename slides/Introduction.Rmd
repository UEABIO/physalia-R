## What is R?


* R is a full programming language

* R is a calculator

* R simulates & generates data

* R reads, processes and manipulates data

* R analyses data

* R makes plots, graphics, reports and presentations

## Workflow

We will do everything in **well-annotated, organized scripts** that contain streamlined and easy-to-follow records of our entire analyses from **raw data** through **final reports**, with **unbreakable** file paths and with a **complete history** of changes made.

class: center, middle

## Workflow

```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width="65%"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/annotated.png")
```

---
## Data wrangling

* Naming things

* Coding basics & tidyverse wrangling/viz

* Good coding habits

* Code annotation & organization

* Data visualization

* Troubleshooting 

* Relative file paths

* Literate programming

## Once we get, wrangle, explore, and visualize data reproducibly, we star building stats skills...

---

## Descriptive statistics

Central Tendency (mean, median, mode)
	`mean()`, `median()`, `mode()`

Data Spread (range, variance, standard deviation)
	`range()`, `var()`, `sd()`


```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width="50%"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/distribution.png")
```

---

## Probability distributions

* Probability distributions come in many types

* They underpin our ability to make inferences from our data

* Deviations from expected distributions underping statistical significance

```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width="70%"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/distributions.png")
```

---

## Hypothesis testing

* Ask a question about some data or a claim. Collect sample(s).

* Define the null and alternative hypotheses 

* Select your criteria (significance level)

* Calculate the test statistic

* Compare the test statistic to the critical statistic (or  convert it to a p-value)

* Make a decision to reject or retain the null

# Statistics is more than p-values and hypothesis testing

## Data analysis needs:

.pull-left[

* Data tidying and cleaning

* Data Exploration

* Data visualization

* Defining research questions

]

.pull-right[

* Produce statistical models

* Interpret outcomes

* Express uncertainty

* Communicate

]

### The p-value is meaningful and can be useful in decision making, but it has dominated stats discussions for too long.

* It’s rarely the most interesting/important part of the story

* At high enough n, everything becomes significant – but does the difference actually matter?

* There is nothing magical about 0.05

* “Wanting” to find p < 0.05 leads to biased science (p-harking, publication bias etc.)

# These tools are not R-specific

## Practice them in whatever tools you use

---
## We will start

* Learning to  work comfortably in R/RStudio projects 

* Understanding R and R programming

* Data wrangling tools


---

## Course Outline

* 1 x weekly lecture

* 1 x weekly computer lab

* Weekly quizzes/small tasks (10%)

* 2 x coursework assignments (30% and 50%)

* 1 x second term stats theory test (10%)

**Ask lots of questions.**

### Get Help

.pull-left[

```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width="100%", fig.alt = "Ask for help in a smart way"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/geordi_help.png")
```

]

.pull-right[
There will be a discussion board on Blackboard to ask all of your coding questions. 

Make your questions as clear as possible

* What are you trying to do?

* What is the exact error message or output

* What code did you run to produce this
