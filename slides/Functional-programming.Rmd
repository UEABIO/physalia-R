## What are functions?

---

## Features

```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width="60%"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/r-function-syntax.png")
```

---
class: center

The body of the function (the statements that are executed when the function is run) is grouped with curly braces ({})

When executing functions it is optional to specify argument names, but in functions with >1 arguments, the order matters

```{r}
myfunction <- function(x){
  x + 4
}

```

```{r}
myfunction(3)
```


```{r}
myfunction(x = 3)
```
---

## Braces

Braces are not needed for functions with a single declaration

.huge[
```{r}
myfunction <- function(x) x + 4
myfunction(2)
```
]

---

## Braces

Braces surround the body in functions with two or more statements

```{r, eval = F}
f <- function(x)  y <- (x * 2) x + y   # ERROR  

```



```{r}
f <- function(x)  {
  y <- (x * 2) 
  x + y
}
```


---

## Short function notation

Replace "function(x) {}" with "\(x){}"

```{r}
add_one <- function(x) {
  return(x + 1)
}
```


```{r}

add_one <- \(x) x + 1

```


---

## Function types

.pull-left[


A function is a process which takes some input, called **arguments**, and produces some output called a **return
value**. Functions may serve the following purposes:

* **Mapping**: Produce some output based on given inputs. A function **maps** input values to output values.

* **Procedures**: A function may be called to perform a sequence of steps. The sequence is known as a procedure, and
programming in this style is known as **procedural programming**.

* **I/O**: Some functions exist to communicate with other parts of the system, such as the screen, storage, system logs
or network.

## Environments

.pull-left[
In R, we have the global environment. This is where all variables are created when you assign (`<-`) something in the
console.

When a function is evaluated, it creates it's own environment. All of the arguments that are passed to the function,
along with any variables created in the function are stored in this new environment.

The function's environment's parent will be the global environment, so we can see all of the variables created in the
global environment. Variables that are created in the function's environment aren't visible from the global environment
though.

If we reassign a variable in a function it will take a copy of that variable rather than mutating the value in the
global environment. If we want to update `x` in the global environment we need to use the `<<-` operator.

  x <- x * 2

# Why do we want to write functions?

Consider the following code (from the book [R4DS][r4ds]). Can you spot the mistake?

``` r
df <- tibble::tibble(
  a = rnorm(10),
  b = rnorm(10),
  c = rnorm(10),
  d = rnorm(10)
)

df$a <- (df$a - min(df$a, na.rm = T)) / 
  (max(df$a, na.rm = T) - min(df$a, na.rm = T))
df$b <- (df$b - min(df$b, na.rm = T)) / 
  (max(df$b, na.rm = T) - min(df$a, na.rm = T))
df$c <- (df$c - min(df$c, na.rm = TRUE)) / 
  (max(df$c, na.rm = T) - min(df$c, na.rm = T))
df$d <- (df$d - min(df$d, na.rm = TRUE)) / 
  (max(df$d, na.rm = T) - min(df$d, na.rm = T))
```

---

## The mistake

``` r
df$b <- (df$b - min(df$b, na.rm = T)) / 
  (max(df$b, na.rm = T) - min(df$a, na.rm = T))
```

Often, when we copy and paste code we introduce subtle bugs, in the previous example we forgot to update the one
argument: me call `min(df$a)` rather than `min(df$b)`.

Writing functions can reduce these types of errors by abstracting away the underlying logic.

## When to write a function

“You should consider writing a function whenever you’ve copied and pasted a block of code more than twice”

 H. Wickham

## Creating a function to solve the last problem

.pull-left[
To the right is one way to turn the previous example into a function.

We pass in a numerical vector (`x` to the function), calculate the minimum and maximum values, then rescale the vector.

Finally we update each column, one by one, using this new function.

We still have an issue here with the potential for copy-paste bugs in that we are doing the same thing 4 times, just
changing the column in the data frame that we are using.

]

.pull-right[
``` r
rescale_01 <- function(x) {
  min_x <- min(x, na.rm = TRUE)
  max_x <- max(x, na.rm = TRUE)
  
  (x - min_x) / (max_x - min_x)
}
```

``` r
# update the columns
df$a <- rescale_01(df$a)
df$b <- rescale_01(df$b)
df$c <- rescale_01(df$c)
df$d <- rescale_01(df$d)
```

]


---

## Creating a function to solve the last problem

.pull-left[

We could use a loop, but we will see how functional programming can help us solve this problem more elegantly later.

One important principle functions help us achieve is **DRY** (don't repeat yourself).
]

.pull-right[
``` r
rescale_01 <- function(x) {
  min_x <- min(x, na.rm = TRUE)
  max_x <- max(x, na.rm = TRUE)
  
  (x - min_x) / (max_x - min_x)
}
```

``` r
# using a loop
for (i in colnames(df)) {
  df[[i]] <- rescale_01(df[[i]])
}
```
]


---

## Sensible errors

```{r, error = TRUE}
rescale <- function(x) {
  
  if (!is.numeric(x)) stop("rescaling must be applied to a number")#<<
  (x - min(x, na.rm = TRUE)) /  
  diff(range(x, na.rm = TRUE))
}


vector <- c("a", "vector", "of", "characters")

rescale(vector)
```

---

## Function writing best practices

* Make sure it does what you want it to do

* Use good names

  * functions do stuff; use verbs
  * arguments are things; use nouns
  * don't overwrite existing functions
  
* Argument order matters

  * tidyverse assumes data input comes first
  * detail arguments come later (e.g. na.rm = TRUE)

* Make output clear and obvious

The Tidyverse style guide is here: http://style.tidyverse.org/


---

## Pure functions

.pull-left[
Pure functions are functions which:

* always produce the same result given the same input

* have no side effects (e.g. reading from a database, writing a file to disk)

* do not use global state (e.g. using variables declared outside of the function)

From before, mappings are pure functions, but the other two types are not.

Pure functions are analogous to mathematical functions.

]

.pull-right[


``` r
function(x, y) {
  x + y
}

function(y) {
  function(x) {
    x + y
  }
}
```
]

## Why do we care about pure functions?

---

## Referential Transparency

.pull-left[
Pure functions are useful as they can make code significantly easier to debug and test. Pure functions have the property
of [referential transparency][ref_transp], which put simply means we can replace an expression with it's corresponding
value.

For example, consider the function `fn` (shown to the right). Because the function `fn` is pure, we know that it will
always return the same result given the same input, so replacing it's call with the return value is going to yield the
same result.

This can make debugging/testing `another_fn` simpler. The behaviour of `another_fn` is not dependent on `fn`.
]

.pull-right[
``` r
fn <- function(x) {
  x + 3
}
```

``` r
another_fn(fn(3), 2)
```

``` r
# we can replace the call to fn() with
# it's return value
another_fn(6, 2)
```
]


---

## Testing

.pull-left[
Knowing that a function will always return the same value given the same inputs makes writing unit tests easier:

* We don't need to set up the global environment correctly before running the function - functions that rely on global state would need to test the function multiple times with the global environment set up with all the possible values.

* We don't need to check the side effects of the function, we just need to check the return value is as expected.
Functions that rely on a side effect can suffer transient errors, e.g. you try to read data from a database, but the
server is temporarily down/busy.

* All we need to do is check that the outputs are correct for given inputs.
]

.pull-right[
``` r
library(testthat)

triangle_number <- function(x) {
  0.5 * x * (x + 1)
}

test_that("it works as expected", {
  expected_that(triangle_number(1),  1)  
  expected_that(triangle_number(2),  3)  
  expected_that(triangle_number(3),  6)  
  expected_that(triangle_number(4), 10)  
  expected_that(triangle_number(5), 15)  
})
```
]


---

# Iteration with loops

.pull-left[
Previously we looked at an example where we used a for loop to run the same function on every column in a dataframe.

We had to iterate in this way because the function that we had (`rescale_01`) worked on individual numeric vectors.

We needed to set up the for loop by first extracting the list of columns, then iterating over each column running the
function.

This is a very common pattern: take a list we want to iterate over, then evaluate some function using that list.

``` r
for(i in colnames(df)) {
  df[[i]] <- rescale_01(df[[i]])
}
```
]

.pull-right[

However, it's very easy to make a mistake creating a loop this way: what if we occidentally update the wrong item in the
dataframe?

``` r
for(i in colnames(df)) {
  df[[1]] <- rescale_01(df[[i]])
}
```

Or we don't correctly initialise the iteration?

``` r
for(i in 1:4) {
  # does our data always have 4 columns?
  df[[i]] <- rescale_01(df[[i]])
}
```
]

---

# `purrr::map()`

.pull-left[
The `map` function from `{purrr}` takes a vector/list, and a function. It the evaluates the function once for each
input, returning the results as a list.

We could replace our loop example quite simply with a map function:

``` r
df <- map_dfc(df, rescale_01)
```

The map function's arguments are

``` r
map(x, fn, ...)
```

* `x` is the vector you wish to iterate over
* `fn` if the function
* ... are any extra arguments the function requires (these are the same for all calls of the function)
]

.pull-right[
The image, courtesy of Advanced R shows graphically how the map function works.

![](https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/f0494d020aa517ae7b1011cea4c4a9f21702df8b/2577b/diagrams/functionals/map.png)
]

---

# `map` in action

.pull-left[
A toy example, let's take a vector of numbers and double them
``` r
values <- 1:5

# we can use a "named function"
double_num <- function(x) 2 * x
map(values, double_num)

# or, we can use an anonymous function
map(values, function(x) 2 * x)
# with R > 4.1, we can use \(x) 2 * x
map(values, \(x) 2 * x)

# we can also use a formula
map(values, ~ .x * 2)
```
]

.pull-right[
Any one of these would return the same thing: a list containing the results

```{r echo=FALSE}
values <- 1:5
map(values, \(x) 2 * x)
```
]

---
## More maps

Other types of map that return specific things

* `map` - list
* `map_lgl` logical
* `map_int` integer
* `map_dbl` double
* `map_chr` character
* `map_df` dataframe

Maps are "type-safe" they will fail if they cannot return the correct data type

---

# `map_*` variants

.pull-left[
In the previous example we can see the output of `map` is a list. It would be more useful for that function to return a
numeric vector instead. Fortunately, there is a simple way to achieve this in purrr:

```{r echo=TRUE}
map_dbl(values, \(x) 2 * x)
```

The variants provided are:

* `map_chr` for a function which returns a character
* `map_int`/`map_dbl` for a function which returns an integer/double
* `map_lgl` for a function which returns a logical (`TRUE`/`FALSE`)
* `map_df`/`map_dfr`/`map_dfc` for a function which returns a dataframe

]

.pull-right[


Now, the example given so far isn't particularly useful: many operations in R are vectorised, so we could just do
`2 * values` and we would get exactly the same results as `map_dbl(values, \(x) 2 * x)`.

`map` functions are useful for cases where we have functions which aren't vectorised and we need to run the function
once for each item in the input vector.

]

---

# `map_df` variants

The data frame variants all do the same sort of thing: if a function returns a dataframe, rather than returning a list
of dataframes, it will bind the results together into a single dataframe:

* `map_df` and `map_dfr` use `bind_rows` to "union" the results together
* `map_dfc` uses `bind_cols` instead

One of the best use cases for `map_df` is to read in a folder full of csv's and combine the results together.

First, let's get a list of all the files in a folder.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
csv_files_list_files <- list.files(path = "data/many_files",
                                    pattern = "csv", full.names = TRUE)
```

```
 [1] "data/many_files/1.csv"  "data/many_files/10.csv" "data/many_files/11.csv" "data/many_files/12.csv"
 [5] "data/many_files/13.csv" "data/many_files/14.csv" "data/many_files/15.csv" "data/many_files/16.csv"
 [9] "data/many_files/17.csv" "data/many_files/18.csv" "data/many_files/19.csv" "data/many_files/2.csv" 
[13] "data/many_files/20.csv" "data/many_files/21.csv" "data/many_files/22.csv" "data/many_files/23.csv"
[17] "data/many_files/24.csv" "data/many_files/25.csv" "data/many_files/3.csv"  "data/many_files/4.csv" 
[21] "data/many_files/5.csv"  "data/many_files/6.csv"  "data/many_files/7.csv"  "data/many_files/8.csv" 
[25] "data/many_files/9.csv"

```

---

## `map_df` continued


Now that we have our list of files to load, we can use the `read_csv` function to load each csv file. 

Here, we pass to
the `read_csv` function the column types used in the files, and we also set the `.id` argument of `map_dfr`. 

This will
create a column in the final dataframe containing the "name" of each item in the list, e.g. the date from the filename.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
df <- map_dfr(csv_files_list_files,
              ~ read_csv(.x))

```

---
# `map2`

So far we have looked at cases where we have a single vector to iterate over, but what if we have two vectors, both of
the same length? We can use the `map2` family of functions! 

.pull-left[

```
map2(.x, .y, .f)
```

```{r echo=TRUE}
letters <- c("a", "b", "c")
times <- 1:3

map2_chr(letters, times, \(x, y) paste(rep(x, y), collapse = ""))
```
]

.pull-right[

```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/map2.png")
```

```

---

## walk/walk2

Along with map, map2 and pmap, we have the walk family of functions: these are useful for if you want to run a function for it's side-effect. 

The walk functions work similarly to the map functions, but you use them when you’re interested in applying a function that performs an action instead of producing data. 

The walk functions are useful for performing actions like writing files and printing plots.

---

## Source scripts & functions

You may find it useful to assemble your custom functions into a dedicated R script.

This can then be sourced for use in any other R scripts when required

```{r, eval = FALSE}
source("path/to/some/file/functions.R")
```

Simply add this line to the top of your R script and you’ll be able to use any functions defined in file.R.

---

# Parallel Computation

The `{furrr}` package makes it easy to convert `map`'s to run in parallel. Almost all of the `map` functions are
available, prefixed with `future_`.

The first thing we need to do after loading the `{furrr}` package is set up the parallel workers. We do this with the
`plan` function.

.pull-left[
```{r, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
library(furrr)
## Loading required package: future

plan(multisession, workers = 10)


fn <- function(x) {
  Sys.sleep(0.5)
  x
}
```
]

.pull-right[
```{r, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
tictoc::tic()
x <- map_dbl(1:10, fn)
tictoc::toc()
# ## 5.13 sec elapsed
tictoc::tic()
y <- future_map_dbl(1:10, fn)
tictoc::toc()
## 3.61 sec elapsed
```
]

---

## Packages

Packages are the fundamental units of reproducible code. When functions become routinely useful to you, you might consider turning them into a package for your personal R `library()` to be called at a moments notice. 

[Writing packages](https://r-pkgs.org/)

If your functions might be useful to others, it can be made public (via Github or CRAN), so that others can use it too. 

A reason to remember to always `cite` R packages
